# Are You Still Angry?

This is a simple web-based interactive game where the user is asked, "Are you still angry at me?" and can click either "Yes" or "No". The "Yes" button moves around the screen when hovered over, making it harder to click. If the user clicks the "No" button, the emoji changes from an angry face to a smiling face.

## Features

- **Yes Button**: The button moves randomly on the screen when hovered over to make it difficult to click.
- **No Button**: When clicked, the emoji changes from an angry face (`ðŸ˜ `) to a smiling face (`ðŸ˜Š`).
- **Responsive Design**: The page is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.
